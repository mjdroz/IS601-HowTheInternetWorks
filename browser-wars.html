            <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
            <p>When the World Wide Web was first created, it was inaccessible to most people. Software engineer Marc
                Andreessen
                envisioned a way to make the Internet accessible to ordinary people instead of just programmers and
                researchers.
                He and other programmers began creating a graphical web browser called Mosaic for free. It went viral
                very, very
                quickly. </p>
            <p>Jim Clark, eventual co-founder of Netscape, contacted Andreessen after noticing how far Mosaic spread. He
                offered
                Andreessen and his colleagues a deal and they accepted. This is how Netscape was formed. They worked to
                create a
                new browser based on Mosaic. In their early stages, Microsoft reached out to Netscape about business
                ventures,
                but Netscape shut them down - they wanted to take Microsoft down and finally challenge the tech
                monopoly. </p>
            <p>Netscape’s browser hit one million downloads quickly. Bill Gates did not appreciate the development of
                this
                innovative software. He and Paul Allen had started Microsoft, which effectively monopolized the computer
                and web
                market. Finally, they had a veritable competitor in Netscape, and they were afraid they were going to be
                wiped
                out. When Netscape launched in 1994, Gates realized that he needed to make a browser himself. Netscape
                hired
                antitrust lawyer Gary Reback in order to defend themselves from Gates’ legal wrath. Reback noted that
                Gates had
                come after many fledgling companies and destroyed them. Reback was famous for coming after
                Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Microsoft arranged a meeting with Netscape. Netscape claims that Microsoft threatened them and said if
                they
                didn’t merge with them they would take their ideas. Microsoft, of course, denies this and claims that it
                was a
                set-up. If Netscape’s claim was true, however, it meant that Microsoft was breaking antitrust laws. </p>
            <p>Shortly after this, Netscape made an initial public offering. It was unconventional, because the company
                had only
                been around about a year. However, their stock was very profitable. After revenue began to climb,
                Andreessen got
                cocky and began to publicly express his disdain for Microsoft. He called Microsoft, “a set of poorly
                debugged
                device drivers,” and this was what finally pushed them to the edge. They focused on creating Internet
                Explorer
                so that they could destroy Netscape. Thomas Reardon is the lead programmer credited with creating the
                web
                browser.</p>
            <p>Internet Explorer had the upper hand because they could afford to give the browser away for free. By
                1997,
                Internet Explorer crushed Netscape. Netscape ended up getting bought out by AOL. Still, the Netscape
                engineers
                made plenty of money, even if they didn’t win out in the end.
                Microsoft, however, ended up getting a historic antitrust lawsuit placed against them after this for
                predatory
                practices that placed a chokehold on consumer’s options. Gates was found guilty and Microsoft’s stock
                market
                valuation dropped by billions overnight. Their company was supposed to be split into two, but that order
                was
                rescinded. However, Gates did lose his CEO position.</p>
