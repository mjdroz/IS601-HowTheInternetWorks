            <h1>Internet Search</h1>
            <p> In this video, John Heilemann tracks the ups and downs of search engine development, and highlights
                where
                certain companies failed and how Google ultimately won out. He begins by chronicling the development of
                Yahoo!,
                which was started by Jerry Yang and David Filo when they were attending Stanford University. The two
                were
                looking up sports stats for their fantasy basketball league, and were frustrated by how difficult it was
                to find
                information. They decided to create a directory by categorizing websites themselves. They dubbed this
                “Jerry &
                David’s Guide to the Worldwide Web”. This then became Yahoo! </p>
            <p> Michael Moritz invested in Yahoo! and was one of the first people to ever invest in a website on this
                scale. Up
                until this point, the Internet was not used for business or commerce, and people hadn’t quite figured
                out a way
                to monetize the web. Initially, Yang and Filo were weary of putting advertisements on their site because
                they
                were afraid of alienating users. They ended up placing banner ads on the site. In the end, consumers
                didn’t
                particularly care about the ads and continued to use the site. This began the web boom and the
                commercialization
                of the web.</p>
            <p> Next, the video dives into the early website eXcite, founded by Joe Kraus. eXcite was Yahoo!’s
                competitor and
                actually utilized an automated search query instead of a manually maintained directory. It was an
                improvement on
                the formula Yahoo! was using at the time, but even these search engines weren’t particularly good at
                searching.
                They often redirected people to scam-ridden advertising sites or pornography. The founders of Google
                noted how
                poor and clunky sites like eXcite ran and sought to improve on them.</p>
            <p> Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were students when they innovated the search engine. They
                realized
                that they could build the engine around linking. Their famous academic paper read, “in essence, Google
                interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B.” Basically, it would determine a
                site’s
                relevance by how often it had been linked. </p>
            <p> Vinod Khosla invested in eXcite and suggested they invest in Google’s technology. eXcite could have
                bought
                Google for $1 million but passed on the deal - in fact, multiple companies turned Google down because
                they
                didn’t understand that search engines could become profitable. Eventually, Andy Bechtolsheim
                acknowledged the
                power Google held and immediately invested. Then venture capitalist and Silicon Valley legend John Doerr
                invested. Google wasn’t immediately profitable, though. They didn’t want to clog their site with banner
                ads like
                Yahoo! did, so they worked to create a more user-friendly version of advertising.</p>
            <p> Bill Gross from Idealab figured out that search queries could provide insight into what people would
                buy, and
                this is how personalized ads came to be. Google latched onto this idea and tried to make a deal with
                Gross but
                failed. They essentially stole Gross’s idea when they created AdSense. The only thing they changed was
                they made
                sure ads were separated from people’s organic searches. Gross sued Google and they eventually settled
                out of
                court.</p>
            <p> Shortly after, Google went public on the stock exchange. Wall Street and financial media criticized
                Google’s
                initial public offering (IPO), but in the end, it was very successful. Anyone who bought Google shares
                in the
                beginning made a LOT of money. Google became the fastest growing company ever, and it showed that the
                web could
                make plenty of money.</p>
