            <h1>The Dot Com Bubble</h1>

            <p>
                The Dot Com Bubble was influential in changing the way people use the internet. During the 1990s, when
                the internet was just making its way into people everyday lives, two young and motivated developers had
                two brilliant ideas. These developers were Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar, and their ideas were to create
                websites that people could use to sell and purchase items using the internet, which meant that they did
                not even have leave their home. While many big tech names discouraged against taking this on, and often
                stated that it would never succeed, both Bezos and Omidyar continued their efforts on their own
                respective websites, Amazon and eBay. Initially, Amazon was designed an online bookstore where customers
                could find any book that they desired, and then Amazon would ship it to their home. As we know, Amazon
                today has transformed from this idea of being solely a bookstore and shifted to selling anything and
                everything. On the other hand, eBay was and still is an online marketplace for people to buy and sell a
                multitude of goods and secondhand products. While focusing on different markets and demographics, both
                Amazon and eBay shared the idea that the internet was for business and companies could thrive by selling
                goods online to more and more people across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Amazon and eBay taking off in the newly established ecommerce marketplace, Wall Street was eager to
                get a piece of the pie. With more and more user gaining access to and using the internet the potential
                to grow small no-name companies to monstrous billion-dollar companies was endless. The only issue that
                stood in the way of venture capitalists and analysts was greed. While some companies like Amazon and
                eBay, thrived in the online marketplace other new companies based off wacky and wild ideas stood no
                chance. With billions of dollars being pumped into the industry a bubble, deemed the Dot Com Bubble, was
                created and stocks of Amazon, eBay, and other ecommerce sites sored. The use of the mentality “get big
                fast”, a phrase coined by Jeff Bezos himself, caused many young software engineers to drop everything
                and try and get a piece of the pie. Sadly, for these new entrants, the bubble was soon to burst.

                In 2002, the stock market to a huge plummet causing many investors to lose millions and several
                companies to end business operations. The combination of the Black Friday crash in 2000 and the 9/11
                attacks in 2001 caused the stock market to hit record lows, and therefore causing the Dot Com Bubble to
                official burst. Many investors were furious with Wall Street analysts, one in particular being Henry
                Blodget, who drove the rise of the Dot Com Bubble and watched it collapse before his eyes. After in
                depth investigations and court cases, Blodget was reprimanded by the SEC and banned from trading with
                IPOs again. Sadly, while Blodget did receive the brunt of the burst, he was not the cause of it.
            </p>

                All in all, the Dot Com Bubble was a rush to get a piece of new landscape in the economic market that
                was never explored. Companies like Amazon and eBay were able to escape the bubble bursting and go on to
                become successful, but others were not so lucky. Some see the Dot Com Bubble as a positive though,
                stating that it needed to happen to give companies a wake call that the internet was here, and it was
                not going anywhere. Call it what you will, but in the it was pain for gain, and the internet definitely
                came out better because of it.
