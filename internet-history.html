            <h1>History of the Internet PowerPoint</h1>

            <p>
                With the cold war at full force, the drive for better technology, especially computer communications,
                was at the
                forefront of the government’s needs. In the late 1950s the Soviet Union was able to launch Sputnik, a
                great
                technological feat, that frightened many leaders in the western hemisphere. With their eyes set on
                beating the
                Soviets to the moon, the need for more powerful computers that were able to communicate with each was
                higher
                than ever.
            <p>
                During the 1960s the development of timesharing helped cut down the time it took for people to get
                answers to
                queries that they were posing to computers. This was done using terminals in which people would type in
                their
                queries and receive an answer in just a few seconds, which considerably quicker than with the use of
                punch
                cards. Bob Taylor of ARPA requested funds to build a computer network that would link separate computers
                together so that one terminal could access more than one machine. Taylor’s idea and development project
                would
                change the world forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of 1969, all four sites (UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah) were
                connected
                on the ARPA Net. There were 18 total mainframe computers on the network, once everything was setup. Now
                that
                everything was connected and working properly, the development of the next major advancement was
                underway,
                email. Email changed the way people communicated both on the ARPA Net and the years following.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the use of the network well underway more and more networks took shape, and soon networks such as
                local
                area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) were formed to help schools and businesses throughout
                the
                country. Each new network however was like a foreign country compared to each other. Devices in each
                network
                only knew how to communicate on their own network, not to others. This is where TCP/IP protocol came in
                and
                added the capability for computers to communicate across networks. With TCP/IP networks could now
                interact with
                each other and this allowed for the modern-day internet, as we know it, to be born.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, while the internet was initially developed for the purposes of government use during the cold
                war, it
                soon developed into something the public could not live without. The amount of knowledge, information,
                and
                communications that could be shared was unimaginable. Without the development of the initial networks,
                like the
                ARPA Net, we would not have the ability to communicate as fast as we do today. Finally, the development
                of the
                internet single handedly changed the world forever and will continue to do so for the foreseeable
                future.
