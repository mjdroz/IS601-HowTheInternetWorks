            <h1>Invention</h1>
            <p>The Internet as we know it was originally envisioned by J.C.R. Licklider. He was one of the first to
                foresee the
                ways computers could interact. Meanwhile, at MIT, Leonard Kleinrock started to apply queuing theory to
                computing
                systems. He showed how data could queue up and transmit through nodes and figured out how to speed up
                connections by implementing demand access and distributed control. Kleinrock and Licklider’s discoveries
                showed
                that the method of telephone circuit systems didn’t have to be the only way communications were
                executed. </p>
            <p>After the Soviets launched Sputnik, Eisenhower created ARPA in 1958 in an attempt to catch up. Computer
                research
                was a main government focus until NASA launched and America focused more on beating the Soviets to
                space. </p>
            <p>Since telephone communications could be interrupted easily, the US military feared that it could cause a
                security
                breach during a nuclear war. Paul Baran was hired by the US government to try and apply Licklider and
                Kleinrock’s ideas during the Cold War. Baran created “packet switching,” which is still a main basis of
                computer
                communications today. It made it so a message could be passed through as long as at least one node was
                available.</p>
            <p>ARPA scientist Bob Taylor needed a way to log into multiple computer terminals so that he didn’t have to
                move
                from computer to computer. He wanted to build a network to make it so one terminal could talk to
                multiple
                terminals. He convinced ARPA that networking in this way would save a lot of time and money down the
                line.</p>
            <p>Larry Roberts built the first experimental connections between computers at MIT. He figured out how to
                create a
                computer network on paper, and in 1968 he started seeking engineers to build the network he envisioned,
                called
                ARPAnet. He had a hard time getting any major company to actually build the project - telephone
                companies didn’t
                think it was possible and computer companies didn’t see any revenue potential. Finally, the smaller
                company BBN,
                headed by Frank Heart, won the contract. Stephen Crocker wrote the code that connected the first
                computer in
                UCLA.</p>
            <p>Heart struggled to keep packets from circulating forever within the IMPs (Interface Message Processor).
                They also
                had an issue keeping data from overflowing, and had problems getting phone lines to carry this data at
                all. The
                team faced many new engineering struggles.</p>
            <p>By the end of 1969, the team managed to connect all four computers that they wanted to connect.
                Eventually,
                Raymond Tomlinson upped the capabilities of ARPAnet by creating the first email program. Bob Metcalfe,
                who later
                invented Ethernet, also worked on ARPAnet. Metcalfe was in charge of compiling a list of what their
                network
                could do, and the demo he helped make included text games and mathematical programs.</p>
            <p>Network use spread after this demo showcase. At first, all the networks were too different from one
                another and
                couldn’t communicate. Vint Cef and Robert E. Kahn created the TCP/IP protocol to allow computers from
                different
                networks to communicate. After about ten years, the protocol was adopted as the universal standard.</p>
            <p>At first, ARPAnet was only for government use. AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy appeared later for personal
                usage. In
                1992, Congress signed a bill that allowed the Internet to leave the exclusive hands of the government.
                At the
                time, there were only 50 web pages. Unfortunately, it was still difficult for the average person to use.
                Tim
                Berners-Lee developed the software that became the World Wide Web. It’s interesting that it was created
                by
                someone uninvolved with ARPAnet. The World Wide Web still wasn’t accessible to the average user until
                Marc
                Andreessen created the browser Mosaic. By the late 90s, the Internet had been completely
                revolutionized.</p>
