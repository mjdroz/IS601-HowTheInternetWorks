            <!--IP Addresses-->
            <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
            <p>
                Internet Protocol Addresses (IP Addresses) are numbered addresses for devices or websites within a
                network, mainly the Internet. As mentioned in the video, “The Internet- IP Addresses and DNS Part 3”,
                these addresses are like home addresses in real life where they list the region, country, subnet, and
                device all in one set of numbers. While not explicitly stating the location of the device, your computer
                will know how to get the address when it attempts to connect or send something to it. Routers on your
                network will communicate with other routers and network devices in order to figure how many hops it will
                take for you to reach your destination. This wonderful invention was the result of the previous work of
                Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. There are two types of IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 was the original
                address format, which contained a set of 32-bit (4 octets) addresses used to identify websites or
                device. Due the monstrous takeoff of the Internet over the last few decades, IANA and other
                organizations have been spearheading a new project, IPv6, which is going to be able to incorporate every
                device in the world for the foreseeable future. IPv6 uses a 128-bit (16 octets) address for devices and
                websites. With the switch to IPv6 underway, the Internet can continue to exponentially grow!
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of how you could you IP addresses:
            <ul>
                <li> Filter IP addresses on a website to limit traffic from certain regions</li>
                <li> Access websites like “www.google.com”</li>
                <li> Subnet a block of addresses to increase the amount of devices on your network</li>
                <li> Spoof your private network with a VPN address. This is handy for security purposes!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We use IP addresses to designate different devices and websites on a network. In the case of a small
                network, IP addresses can be used to differentiate devices and help keep the network traffic organized
                and going in the right direction. As for the Internet, IP addresses are used to communicate with
                websites, applications, and other devices. IP addresses enable the Internet to have things like websites
                and communication services. Without IP addresses, the Internet would not be as useful as it today!
            </p>
            <!--Packets-->
            <h2>Packets</h2>
            <p>
                The formal definition of a packet, according to Wikipedia, is that “a packet is a formatted unit of
                data”. Packets contain control information, which tells them where to go and where they are coming from,
                and user data, which is sometimes called the payload. According to the video “The Internet- Packets,
                Routing and Reliability Part 4”, packets carry information from one computer to another without having a
                defined path. Also mentioned in the video, packets carry two parts of information when it comes to
                guidance, the "to" and "from" addresses. It is important to note that these addresses are IP addresses,
                which were defined above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of how packets would be used would be:
            <ul>
                <li> Playing a song from Spotify (as seen in “The Internet- Packets, Routing and Reliability Part 4”)
                </li>
                <li> Playing a video from YouTube</li>
                <li> Sending a file to a friend</li>
                <li> Downloading software from a website</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We use packets to send and receive information in a timely and effective manner. Packets are used to
                split the data up into “chunks” and send it to the recipient safely. Without packets, we would see data
                transmission slowing down, or stopped all together. Packets give the users the ability to send large
                amounts of data to the recipient, which again makes communication over the Internet a whole lot easier.
                Finally, packets use the transport protocol called TCP. This protocol is used to make sure all data is
                being sent and receive without any errors, and therefore, it allows for a better user experience. All in
                all, packets are envelopes of the Internet, as they carry data from one computer to the next ensuring it
                is not tampered with.
            </p>
            <!--Routing-->
            <h2>Routing</h2>
            <p>
                The formal definition of routing is the process of directing traffic on a network or multiple networks.
                Routing is done through the use of networking routers. These devices are designed to find the “path of
                least resistance” or in other words the shortest path to the destination. As noted in the video “The
                Internet- Packets, Routing and Reliability Part 4”, sometimes the best route for data to travel is not
                always the most direct route. Having multiple routes for data to travel logged inside of the router,
                allows for something called fault tolerance. This means that if one or more paths are broken there are
                other routes that become the new “fastest” route. If you have not noticed already, the more routers that
                you have, the more reliable the transmission of data will be on that network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of routing would be:
            <ul>
                <li> Transmitting songs from Spotify (as seen in “The Internet- Packets, Routing and Reliability Part
                    4”)
                </li>
                <li> Transmitting an email across a network</li>
                <li> Connecting a user to a website not hosted on the local network</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Routing is the backbone of the Internet’s communication framework. Without this technology, information
                and data being sent across networks would either never make it to the target or be damaged in
                transmission. Routing is also used to connect users to websites that are scattered throughout the
                Internet. Even if the router does not know the address of the site you are trying to access, it will ask
                other routers around it to help find the IP address for the site. Routing is a useful tool that reshaped
                how we use the Internet, especially in a global environment. Overall, this technology allows for better
                use of data transmission and connectivity throughout the Internet.
