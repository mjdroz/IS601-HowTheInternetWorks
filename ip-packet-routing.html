            <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
            <p>
                Internet Protocol Addresses (IP Addresses) are numbered addresses for devices or websites within a
                network, mainly the Internet. These addresses are like home addresses in real life where they list the
                region, country, subnet, and device all in one set of numbers. While not explicitly stating the location
                of the device, your computer will know how to get the address when it attempts to connect or send
                something to it. Routers on your network will communicate with other routers and network devices in
                order to figure how many hops it will take for you to reach your destination. This wonderful invention
                was the result of the previous work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. There are two types of IP addresses, IPv4
                and IPv6. IPv4 was the original address format, which contained a set of 32-bit (4 octets) addresses
                used to identify websites or device. Due the monstrous takeoff of the Internet over the last few
                decades, IANA and other organizations have been spearheading a new project, IPv6, which is going to be
                able to incorporate every device in the world for the foreseeable future. IPv6 uses a 128-bit (16
                octets) address for devices and websites. With the switch to IPv6 underway, the Internet can continue to
                exponentially grow!
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples of how you could you IP addresses:
            <ul>
                <li> Filter IP addresses on a website to limit traffic from certain regions</li>
                <li> Access websites like “www.google.com”</li>
                <li> Subnet a block of addresses to increase the amount of devices on your network</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                One important topic that I should mention here that does not fall under a particular use or example
                would be virtual private networks (VPNs). These “networks” are often purchased from providers, such as
                NordVPN, and are “fake” IP addresses. These can be used to spoof your location, so that you can view
                certain content, but most people use it to secure their home or office networks from being compromised.
                While the Internet on the surface seems like a fun and enjoyable place to spend some time, there are bad
                apples roaming around looking to do harm to those who are less technically inclined. That is why VPN
                services like Nord are so popular and are used by many people to hide their real addresses from
                potential attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use IP addresses to designate different devices and websites on a network. In the case of a small
                network, IP addresses can be used to differentiate devices and help keep the network traffic organized
                and going in the right direction. As for the Internet, IP addresses are used to communicate with
                websites, applications, and other devices. IP addresses enable the Internet to have things like websites
                and communication services. Without IP addresses, the Internet would not be as useful as it today!
