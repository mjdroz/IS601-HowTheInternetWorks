            <h1>People of the Internet</h1>

            <p>
                With the internet’s transition from a communication-oriented invention to an ecommerce driven invention
                in
                the
                late 1990s, it was only a matter of time before the communication aspect of the internet took the
                forefront
                yet
                again. Media is use and consumed by everyone who lives in a first world setting with access to
                television,
                newspaper, and internet. Big media companies look to maximize profits by channeling the media that they
                output
                through certain outlets, therefore making it filtered and a pay to use system. With this in mind,
                companies
                like
                Facebook and YouTube strived from the very beginning to be about the consumer and make it so that the
                big
                companies would no longer have control over what you are viewing, listening to, or watching. This idea
                of
                media
                accessibility can be seen them in motto for YouTube towards its beginning, “broadcast yourself”, or the
                idea
                that everyone no matter your status can have the ability to put yourself out there for the world to see.
                This
                was a great a idea that came at a time where big media companies were looking to throttle the content
                that
                they
                were distributing, in an attempt to make more money.
            </p>
            <p>
                One version of media, music, was targeted in the late 1990s and earlier 2000s by a small startup company
                named
                Napster. Napster revolutionized the idea that media, like music, should be accessible in more than just
                one
                channel, which at the time was just the record labels. Napster led the way for companies like YouTube to
                become
                media giants regarding music, video, and consumption of media through outlets other than big-wig
                companies.
                They
                were able to break the distribution monopolies that record labels in the music industry held and made
                the
                labels
                very angry in the process. This was the new wave of media, and it was going to take over whether the
                rich
                record
                label executives liked it or not. In the end, Napster had little backing, monetarily speaking, and were
                soon
                sued and forced to shut down their operations. However, this would not stop more and more websites like
                Napster
                to rise and take its place.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Napster in the past, companies like YouTube and Facebook sought to take advantage of the new way of
                media
                that they were witnessing. YouTube seized the opportunity to allow users to “broadcast yourself”, while
                Facebook
                rallied on the idea of connecting people together for a better information flow and exchange. Although
                companies
                like Myspace posed a challenge to Facebook initially, in the long Facebook was able to outlast and
                survive
                the
                initial competition, which lead to the company growing to absurd proportions. As for YouTube, the
                founders
                were
                able to sell the company in 2006 to Google for around $1.6 billion, and the platform was able to explode
                from
                there, making it the media powerhouse it is today.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, media consumption has had many changes over the past few decades and thanks to the
                development
                of
                the internet big companies are no longer in control over information and media flow, or so we think.
                While
                the
                internet has made many great changes to society it has brought about some interesting villains. In
                today’s
                market, Facebook has grown to become an empire, but this came a severe cost. The company, some would
                say,
                lacks
                integrity and is straying away from its original purpose. While YouTube has not changed all too much
                purpose
                wise, the content restriction and enforcement has become a bit of a problem in recent years. Only time
                can
                tell
                where these giants are going to end up next.
